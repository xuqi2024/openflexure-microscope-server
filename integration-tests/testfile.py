"""This module fires up a server in a subprocess to allow for integration tests.

These are separated from the unit tests to stop them artificially inflating the test
coverage. For now this file should be run directly not with a test framework.

These tests are designed to run on CI. They should work on Linux or WSL for local
debugging.
